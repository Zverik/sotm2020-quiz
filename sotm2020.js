  "intro": "Welcome! This is a single-player version of the trivia quiz that was played at the [State of the Map 2020](https://2020.stateofthemap.org) conference. Some answers might have gotten stale, so this might be a fun history lesson for you. For each question, choose one answer and see how many people did the same choice. Unlike the real-time version, there are no time-limits, but please don't google questions: that would take the fun out. And that's what this quiz is for: some knowledge and some fun!\n\nThank you to Frederik Ramm, Sergey Golubev, and Trudy Namitala for helping with the questions!",

  "ranks": ["a Novice Mapper", "a Long-time Mapper", "an OpenStreetMap Expert", "Michael Reichert"],
  "afterword": "Yay, you have finished the quiz! Hope you have learnt something interesting about OpenStreetMap. Now back to mapping and helping other people map, I guess. Thank you!",

Karlsruhe had a SotM-EU in 2014 (some confuse it with Heidelberg), and Toronto lost the bid in 2015."

      "explanation": "In June 2020, Accenture [evaluated OpenStreetMap](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/software-platforms/navigating-openstreetmap) to cost around 1.67 billion US dollars. We doubt you could even map both Koreas with that money on the OSM level of detail."

      "explanation": "[Lada factory](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/47121317) is indeed the biggest building in the world, almost 1 km². Of course there are many bigger incorrectly tagged buildings. [GM car factory](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/1170236) in Ontario was — and probably is — the biggest bulding multipolygon, before closure it was the third biggest building in the world (2nd is Beijing Airport). Pictured is the Boeing factory, which has the largest usable volume (footprint × height)."

      "stats": [28, 5, 21, 1],
      "explanation": "This is a hard question: we know the most popular values are platform and stop_position. 'Station' and 'stop_area_group' are documented and used on 86k and 5k objects. 'Pole' is used three times often than 'stop', 3k and 1k respectively."

      "stats": [20, 15, 11, 5],

      "correct": [3],
      "stats": [6, 11, 31, 9],
      "explanation": "All four of these were submitted for microgrants. Potlatch would disappear this year because Flash support will be finally dropped from all browsers. The 360° Editor would have been a better version of a Mapillary-based Deriviste editor, and not tied to Mapillary. With this microgrant, StreetComplete would get a feature of updating already existing map features."

      "stats": [6, 1, 28, 18],

      "stats": [11, 12, 14, 19],
      "explanation": "Osmarender is basically a set of transformation rules in XSLT language, based on XML. It takes a raw OSM XML and transforms it into SVG. Obviously it doesn't work for large sets of data, so with the growth of OpenStreetMap, it became obsolete."

      "correct": [2],
      "stats": [26, 37, 9, 4],
      "explanation": "The database stores seven decimal digits for latitude and longitude. Around equator, that's roughly 1 centimeter. \n\n0.5 m is a common resolution of satellite imagery, and 2-5 m is a precision of GPS coordinates. You can say that in areas without good imagery coverage, where the only source are GPS tracks, the map precision is around 2-5 m."

      "explanation": "[Since 1st of July](https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2020/06/25/new-licence-for-the-standard-style-tiles-from-openstreetmap-org/), we have dropped the CC-BY-SA license for the tiles, and rely on the \"Produced Works\" clause of the ODbL license. That didn't go anywhere, and you still has to attribute OpenStreetMap when using the tiles. Any extra licenses just impose additional restrictions, and we don't want that — hence there is no license attached to the tiles."
